<p>This is the only Fettucini Alfredo recipe you will ever need. It is incredibly creamy and succulent. It will only take you 20 minutes to cook.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>10 ounces of fettucini pasta</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of butter</li>
        <li>5 cloves of chopped garlic</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>2 cups freshly grated parmesan</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried parsley</li>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
    </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet melt butter and add chopped garlic. Cook on low for about 5 minutes, stirring often to prevent garlic from burning.</li>
            <li>Pour about a 1/4 cup of heavy cream into a small bowl. Add egg yolk and beat together; set aside.</li>
            <li>Pour remaining cream into the skillet. Increase heat to medium-high. As cream starts to boil, mix rapidly using a whisk. Add egg mixture slowly to prevent curdling, whisking until well blended. Stir in 1 cup Parmesan cheese until combined.</li>
            <li>Add remaining Parmesan cheese and parsley; mix until smooth. Remove from heat and serve over cooked pasta.</li>
        </ol>
