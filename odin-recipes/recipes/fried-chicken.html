        <h1>How to Make Fried Chicken</h1>
    <img src="../images/Friedchicken.png" alt="Completed Fried Chicken">
<p>This is the only fried chicken recipe you will ever need. It is the crispiest, juciest fried chicken 
    I have ever tried. It will take you around 1 hour and 20 minutes to make.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds of breasts, drumsticks, wings, and or thighs</li>
        <li>1 cup of buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of parprika</li>
        <li>2 quarts of Vegetable oil</li>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
            <li>Skin your cut up chicken</li>
            <li>Pour the flour into a large plastic bag, season with paprika, salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Dip the chicken in buttermilk, then a few at a time, put them in the bag with the flour.</li>
            <li>Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper. <strong>LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY, THIS IS CRUCIAL.</strong></li>
            <li>Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat until <strong>VERY</strong> hot</li>
            <li>Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in oil on both sides.</li>
            <li>When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes (the chicken will be cooked through but not crispy). Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue to fry until crispy.</li>
        </ol>
